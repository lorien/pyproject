# Python Project Template for Cookiecutter

This is a template for [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to create a python project.
Template includes basic configs to run pytest, mypy, pylint, flake8 and bandit linters.
All tools' configurations except flake8 are stored in pyproject.toml. Flake8 can't use pyproject.toml yet.

Usage:

* Install cookiecutter: `pip install cookiecutter`
* Run command: `cookiecutter gh:lorien/pyproject` and provide answers
    for questions which cookiecutter will ask you. The value of "project\_name" will be
    used to create a new directory with project contents.
