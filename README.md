# Python Project Template for Cookiecutter

This is cookiecutter template I use to start any python project.

How to use:

* Install cookiecutter: `pip install cookiecutter`
* Run command: `cookiecutter gh:lorien/pyproject` and provide answers
    for questions which cookiecutter will ask you. Note that value of "project\_name" would be
    a name of directory where cookiecutter will put all new project's files.
